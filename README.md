Our project is quite extensive — its full package exceeds 30 gigabytes, even after compression. Due to its size, direct file sharing isn’t practical at this time.

However, to provide a clear overview of our work, we’ve prepared a comprehensive demonstration video showcasing how our code functions in detail. 
P.S Github doesn't allow you to open .mp4 videos. You should download it by pressing "View Raw" button or click download icon.

Should you require access to the complete project files, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at ansartleubaev1@gmail.com
 — We’ll be glad to arrange secure file transfer or cloud access.
